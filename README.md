This is the code associated to the paper "Using Large Language Models to Suggest Informative Prior Distributions in Bayesian Regression Analysis" <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18425-9" target="_blank">Link</a>.

The paper analyzed the potential of using LLMs to select informative prior distributions in Bayesian regression analysis. Three different LLMs were analyzed, namely ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. The LLMs were able to select the correct direction for different associations between the predictors and the response/output, demonstrating a great potential for using LLM to select informative priors. However, a significant challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors, as the LLMs demonstrated a tendency towards both overconfidence and underconfidence.
